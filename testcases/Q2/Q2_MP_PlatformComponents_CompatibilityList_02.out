%Q2 - Platform Compatibility Question:
	%Output:
		compatible (= required and provided):				Mike; RAM; SIM; Vibrator; Speakers; SOSButton; ClockTimer;
										Display; LED;		% required with constraint
										GSM; Keyboard		% alternatively required
		incompatible (= required but missing):				DTMFToneDecoder
		incompatible (= required but constraint not met):		Flash		% we could other constraints, e.g. Languages requiring huge space, then make it fail
		(provided (all other provided components that are not required for the application): 	just subtract InputConfig - Output
	%open issue: shall we further categorize/mark the 1:n relations (e.g. alternatively required and provided/missing/don'tCare)
