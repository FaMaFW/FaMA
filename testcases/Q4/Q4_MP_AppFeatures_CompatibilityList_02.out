%for CaseStudy 2, Basic Feature Phone

%Q4 - Platform Migration Question:
	%Output:
		enabled, unaffected:		SMS; Call; CallInfo; TextInput; AudioInput; TextOutput; TactileFeedback; VisualIndicator; Torch; AudioOutput; AlarmClock; SMSToPhonebook; Calculator

		enabled, positively affected:	MMS; InternetAccess; Phonebook [memSize]; PositionInformation; Acceleration; PicVideoInput; GraphicsOutput [resolution]; HandsfreeMode

		limited, negatively affected:	-

		conflicted, disabled:		EmergencyProcedure	% should rather be "limited" category, since DTMFToneDecoder can be implemented in SW on this powerful CPU - how to distinguish?
		
	%open issue: can/shall we provide explanation why sthg was positively/negativel affected? (e.g. Phonebook positively affected, due to increased FlashSize --> more entries possible)
	%open issue: can/shall we really distinguish between limited and conflicted? or shall we merge them into single category "conflicted/limited"?


	%intermediate Output (preliminary step, top-to-bottom analysis):	tbd if helpful
	%2do: probably have to split up Q4 into Q4.1 - Q4.4
