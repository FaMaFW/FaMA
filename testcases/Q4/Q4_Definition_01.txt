Q4 - Platform Migration Question:
	Investigating potential conflicts of a platform migration is a prevailing problem in today's mobile world and at the core of Q4. Given a particular application and the source and target platforms, the question will highlight potential conflicts caused by such migrations.
	The question sort of combines all the previously defined questions, and uses those for the "master question" Q4.

	- Input: ConfTop1, the configuration of selected application functionalities. A variation would be to pass the complete top feature model (as opposed to a specific application configuration), and see the impact on this layer caused by the migration.
			 ConfBottom1, the provided modules of the current platform in use (= where to port from).
			 ConfBottom2, the provided modules of the future platform (= where to port to).
			 Mapping
	- Output: ConfTopCompatibility, a list of compatible and incompatible features after a platform change (categorized by their level of compatibility).
	
	Example:
		- Input:  MP_AppFeatures_Config_01.afm
				  MP_PlatformComponents_Config_01.afm
				  MP_PlatformComponents_Config_02.afm
				  MP_Mapping_01.map
		- Output: Q4_MP_AppFeatures_CompatibilityList_01.out
						unaffected/compatible:				PositionInformation, VoiceAudioInput
						positively affected/compatible:		PicVideoInput, GraphicsOutput
						negatively affected/incompatible:	SMS, CSCall
						
	Algo Q4 in prosa: TBD.

				
	Use Cases:
		Scenario 1: The described video chat application shall be ported from a Smartphone to a Tablet; what are the consequences?
					The developer can also make circular conclusions on his own (such as: we have bigger screen with bigger resolution --> need more powerful hardware, too)
			- given: the specifications of two platforms (source, target), and the application to be checked for compatibility
			- find: application features and how they are affected by the platform change (e.g., are no longer supported, or could be positively affected (e.g. due to a better display))
			
		Scenario 2: OEM is required to make a platform change (for technological or economical reasons); can the functionality currently in use be maintained?
			- given: same as above
			- find: same as above; basically information for each of the currently used application features on how they are affected
