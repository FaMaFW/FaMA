%Mapping
%(valid mapping will be ensured by tool-supported mapping selection in future)

%SMS requires CellularRadio;	% a relation to a parent component is not supported (yet?); could be modeled by creating dependencies to each child;
Call requires GSM or UMTS;
VoIP requires (GPRS or UMTS or HSPA or WiFi) if [bottom.datarate >= top.datarate];	% or: VoIP requires InternetAccess
InternetAccess requires (GPRS or UMTS or HSPA or WiFi) if [bottom.datarate >= top.datarate];
%VoIP requires SIP and RTP	% not supported for now; could be used as syntactic sugar:= short for two separate relations
VoIP requires SIP
PositionInformation requires (GPS or CellularRadio or WiFi) with [bottom.accuracy <= top.accuracy];		% i.e., at least one component must match the criterion (e.g., GPS.accuracy=10m < PositionInformation.accuracy=1000m)
VoiceAudioInput requires Mike
PicVideoInput requires Camera with [bottom.resolution >= top.resolution]
PicVideoInput requires Camera with [bottom.fps >= top.fps]
PicVideoInput requires Camera with [bottom.position == top.position]	% if impracticable, we could just as well make 2 Camera instances (front, back)
GraphicsOutput requires Display		% we could also require a minimum resolution for the display; not specified for now
PicVideoInput requires Camera with [bottom.numOfCams >= top.numOfCams]


%different types of inter-tree relations:
%(essentially, there are 4 types overall; 1:1, 1:n, and those two combined with a constraint)
%interpretation: top layer feature requires bottom layer feature

	% 1-to-1:
(1)	A requires B		
	% if B is included in bottomLayer, success. else, "single-feature-missing error".
(2)	A requires B with [top.x > bottom.y]
	% if B is included in bottomLayer, and matches the criterion, success. else, "feature-missing error" (with hint which constraint is not met) (maybe distinguish between 'component missing' and 'constraint not met'?)
	% initial formulation: "A conditionally requires B if [top.x > bottom.y]" - however, this sounds like: if constraint is not met, bottomA is not required; is NOT true though...bottomA is always required, but must meet the requirement!
	% variation: how about formulation "A requires B and [top.x > bottom.y]"? advantage: doesn't need any new vocabulary, AND is widely understood. (does it transport correct meaning though?)

	% 1-to-N:
	% (A requires B and C)	
	% not supported for now; is just syntactic sugar; translate it into separate mapping: A requires B, A requires C
(3)	A requires (B or C)		
	% if B or C (or both) included in bottomLayer, success. else (= non included), "group-feature-missing error".
(4)	A requires (B or C) with [top.x > bottom.y]	
	% at least one feature must match the criterion;	if B or C (or both) included in bottomLayer, and (at least one) matches the criterion, success. else, "group-feature-missing error" (with hint which constraint is not met)

order of priority: (2), (1), (4), (3)		% will be relevant for relations with conflicting categories
