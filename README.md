Please, follow up the link at http://famafw.github.io/FaMA/ to see the full document.

This guide is designed to get you up and running for developing extensions to the FAMA Framework and, as an example, it shows the process of developing and integrating a new reasoner. It is meant to be used alongside the source code of the new reasoner example as it provides extensive documentation and comments describing its inner workings.
